		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi!</p>
		<p>I am a 22 year old Jewish guy currently living in California. I have spent most of my life in the USA, but I travel as much as possible; I have now been to six other countries and a handful of other states. Besides tourism, I have studied abroad in two countries (Israel and Australia) and lived in two other states (Florida and New York).</p>
		<p>I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. I minored in English. </p>
		<p>My favorite hobbies are gaming, hiking, and writing. Consuming media and exploring the world is pretty fun. If you're here looking for a recommendation, go to New Zealand's South Island, play Crusader Kings II on the flight, and write about it.</p>
		<p>I am a fairly opinionated person. On the <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/">Political Compass</a>, I am close to the center on the left-libertarian box, but here are a few words that I identify with, in no particular order:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Environmentalism</li>
			<li>Pacifism</li>
			<li>Humanism</li>
		</ul>
		<p>My favorite animal is the majestic goat. I have lived on (what amounts to) a farm with half a dozen goats and even took a goat (enterprise) class at Cal Poly. I have been on both Ultimate Frisbee and Fencing teams, though I wasn't particularly talented/skilled and did not stick with either sport for long. My personal library has over 100 books, and I've read less than half of them. I dabble with playing bass guitar, ukulele, and piano, being self-taught on the latter two. I memorized 141 digits of pi for a contest in middle school and still remember them. I built my desktop computer in high school and was briefly an Electrical Engineering major before switching to Computer Science. Community is my favorite TV show. The best book I read recently was Mrs. Dalloway. I am at a net loss in crypto-currency purchases. I like to ramble, in case you haven't noticed. If you are somehow still interested in random facts about me, poke around this site more to find my weirdness embedded in everything.</p>
