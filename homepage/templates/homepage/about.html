		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi!</p>
		<p>I am a 22 year old student currently living in California. I have spent most of my life in the USA, but I travel as much as I can, having now been to six other countries and a handful of states. Besides just traveling, I have studied abroad in two countries (Israel and Australia) and lived in two other states (Florida and New York).</p>
		<p>I am a recent graduate from the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO). I majored in Computer Science and minored in English. </p>
		<p>My hobbies are gaming, hiking, and writing. My Steam library currently contains 139 games, I have 5 consoles (PS2, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, PS4), I've been running D&D games for about a year, and I have burgeoning board game collection. I don't have a list of hiking equipment or anything, but I am blessed to have grown up in California, went to school in a mountainous region, and have the privilege to have visited New Zealand. I am relatively new to writing, having only completed a couple of stories, but I am preparing to publish them on this site after some more technical development.</p>
		<p>I am a fairly political person and seem to have opinions on most issues. On the <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/">Political Compass</a>, I am close to the center on the left-libertarian box. I am an outspoken critic of President Trump and his administration. I am Jewish and wish I were more practising. I am a vegetarian and a pacifist.</p>
		<p>My favorite animal is the majestic goat. I have lived on (what amounts to) a farm with half a dozen goats and even took a goat (enterprise) class at Cal Poly. I have been on both Ultimate Frisbee and Fencing teams, though I wasn't particularly talented/skilled and did not stick with either sport long-term. My personal library has over 100 books, and I've read less than half of them. I dabble with playing bass guitar, ukulele, and piano, being self-taught on the latter two. I memorized 141 digits of pi for a contest in middle school and still remember them. I built my desktop computer in high school and was briefly an Electrical Engineering major before switching to CS. Community is my favorite TV show. The best book I read recently was Mrs. Dalloway. I am at a net loss in crypto-currency purchases. If you are somehow still interested in random facts about me, shoot me an email or a message and I'll add even more.</p>
