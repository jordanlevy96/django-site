        <h2>Contact Me</h2>
        <p>Here are some social media platforms you can reach me on. You can also <a href="mailto:jordanlevy96+website@gmail.com">email me</a> if you so please.</p>

        <h3>Facebook</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, the platform I spend the most time on. I find it great for messaging and sharing memes, and don't do much else on there.</p>
        <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Jordan.X.Levy">Probably not the best way to reach me if I don't already know you.</a>

        <h3>LinkedIn</h3>
        <p>If this is interesting to you, awesome! I am actively searching for professional opportunities. I am particularly interested in game development, have lots of experience in web development (mostly front-end but definitely back-end too), and have dabbled in other software disciplines through my studies. I am also interested in writing and editing.</p>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-levy-704952a2/">Professional development, woo!</a>

        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>I'm not sure if GitHub really counts as social media, but I wanted to include it here either way. Unfortunately, some of my coolest projects must be private.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/jordanlevy96">If you look closely at my commits, you can tell when my deadlines are!</a>
