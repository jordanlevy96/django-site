		<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
		<p>This is a labor of love that I began in the Summer of 2016. One day, I hope this site can serve the purpose that Michel de Montaigne's collection of essays intended for him: opening himself up for the world to see. A sort of modern, living autobiography--in Montaigne's words: "I want to be seen here in my simple, natural, ordinary fashion, without straining or artifice; for it is myself that I portray."</p>
